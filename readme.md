Thid modification if for the DaRk_dOg rev2 Ender -> switchwire conversion

You will need:

9mm Gates 2GT pully (20t)

~1000mm 9mm x 2GT belt

2x F965-2RS flanged 4x13x5 bearings

1x 4x13x5 NONFLANGED bearing (4mm thick, no flange, 13mm OD and 5mm ID. 

2x 1x10x5mm spacer/shim

1x 5 x 20mm precision steel pin (optional)

Should be self explanitory, non flanged bearing goes between the two flanged bearings increasing belt path by 3mm for 9mm belt. 

Changes have been made to the front pulley and carriage. The stock rear motor mount works fine with 6 or 9mm belt so no modification needed. 


UPDATE: Uploaded pinmod version of innner idler to be used with 5 x 20mm steel precision pin/dowel instead of screw.
